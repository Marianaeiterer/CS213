    My name is <b>Mariana Lopes</b>, but I like to be called by my nickname Mari... if you ever call me Mariana, I'll assume you are angry at me! I'm 25 years old and I'm engaged and we plan to marry this year :D I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ since I was born, 
     and I served a mission in <i style="color: rgb(5, 168, 5);">SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.</i>
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I'm studying Applied Technology at BYUI, I like to program and I work with this.
        The thing I love most about BYUI is the flexibility to study and how I have learned so much from the classes I take. 
        Before starting to study at BYUI I thought that studying online was easy and I wouldn't really learn the things, but I was so wrong. I love how the assignments and 
        really  make me work and learn.
